# Simple Recipe Webpage (HTML Only)

This project is a static webpage designed to display multiple recipes with their ingredients and instructions. It is built using **pure HTML5** to demonstrate basic content structuring and semantic HTML elements without relying on CSS for styling or JavaScript for interactivity.

## 🍽️ Features

* **Recipe Organization:** Each recipe is contained within a `<section>` for clear separation.
* **Structured Data:** Uses semantic lists (`<ul>` for ingredients, `<ol>` for instructions) to present information clearly.
* **Image Placeholders:** Includes `<figure>` and `<img>` tags for displaying recipe visuals (placeholders are used, as actual image files are not included).
* **Clear Hierarchy:** Utilizes `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags to establish a logical content hierarchy.
* **Basic Metadata:** Includes essential elements like `<head>` with `title` and `meta` tags.

## 🛠️ Technology Used

* **HTML5** (HyperText Markup Language)

## 💻 How to Use

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy the entire HTML code for the recipe page and save it as an `.html` file (e.g., `recipes.html`).
2.  **Open in Browser:** Double-click the saved file to open it in any modern web browser.
3.  **View Structure:** Observe how the recipes, ingredients, and instructions are structured using standard HTML elements.

## ⚠️ Limitations (HTML Only)

Since this project strictly adheres to the "HTML Only" constraint, it has the following limitations:

* **No Styling:** The page appearance is the browser's default—it lacks custom fonts, colors, borders, or sophisticated layout, as these require **CSS**.
* **No Interactivity:** There are no interactive features (like search, filters, or expandable sections) as this requires **JavaScript**.
* **Placeholder Images:** The `<img>` tags use placeholder names (`pancakes-placeholder.jpg`, `carbonara-placeholder.jpg`) and will not display images unless you manually create and place those files in the same directory as the HTML file.

**Next Steps for Improvement:**

To make this page visually appealing and more professional, the immediate next step would be to introduce **CSS**.
